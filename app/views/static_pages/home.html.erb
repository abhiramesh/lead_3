			<b>Basics of Social Security Disability Benefits</b>
				<br><br>
			Social Security Disability Benefits claims can take a long time to process and have a high chance of being denied. Up to 70% of all SSDI applications are denied the first time. Many of these applicants are actually qualified but are denied on a technicality. Partnering with an attorney increases your chances of winning disability benefits and speeds the time it takes for your case to go through the legal system.
			Our network of attorneys helps guide the disabled through the difficult appeals and application processes. In fact, most Social Security Disability claims are successful at the appeals level. An attorney can increase your chances of getting your case heard by a judge, where you have the best chance of winning.
			There Are Time Restrictions on Appeals
			If you have been denied, you still have a good chance of winning benefits. However, you need to understand how the appeals process works. When you are denied, you are given a period during which you can appeal. If you wait too long, you may lose your chance. A disability lawyer knows the appeal steps and can present a strong appeals case on your behalf.
			<br><br>
			<b>Am I Eligible?</b>
			<br><br>
			The two most important qualifications for Social Security Disability Benefits are that you are disabled, and that you have enough work credits. The Social Security Administration enforces a strict definition of “disabled,” which you must meet in order to receive benefits. Proving that you are disabled is often the most difficult part of filing a disabilities claim. Work credits are years that you have worked and paid into Social Security. Unless you have spent enough years working, you are not eligible to receive benefits.
			<br><br>
			Our focus is to help you win your Social Security Disability (SSDI) case and receive benefits. The attorneys at Disability Legal Network have helped thousands of the disabled get the benefits they deserve. These representatives will walk you through the entire process, from initial application to your hearing and awards. They are also skilled at every level of the legal system, and can help you get your case reconsidered and win your appeal. Our attorneys start the process with a free eligibility evaluation. We don’t get paid unless you win.

If a case is won in your favor, the fee is not paid out of your pocket, but instead is paid directly to the attorney/advocate directly from the Social Security Administration.  The fees are set by the Social Security Administration and your representative is not allowed to charge more than $6,000 or 25% of all past due benefits whichever is less through the initial hearing.  If you are not successful at the initial hearing and your attorney/advocate must appeal your case, they can charge additional fees which will be stated in your fee agreement with that attorney/advocate.  Each attorney or advocate will have you sign a fee agreement that will allow them to be paid a fee directly by the Social Security Administration.
